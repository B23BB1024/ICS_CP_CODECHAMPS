# ICS_CP_CODECHAMPS
Summary
This C program is an area calculator that allows the user to calculate the area of various geometric shapes. Here's a summary of the code:

Header Inclusions: The program includes necessary header files for standard input/output, math functions, and standard library functions.

Function Prototypes: Prototype declarations for functions that calculate the area of different geometric shapes and convert square meters to square feet.

Main Function: The main function begins with a welcome message and prompts the user to continue or exit. It then enters a loop where the user can choose different geometric shapes to calculate their areas. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.

Shape Calculation: The program includes separate functions to calculate the area of shapes like Rectangle, Square, Circle, Triangle, Trapezium, Ellipse, Parallelogram, Rhombus, and Regular Polygon. Each case in the switch statement corresponds to a specific shape.

Conversion Function: There's a function to convert square meters to square feet.

Comments: Comments are added throughout the code to explain the purpose of each section, making it more readable and understandable.

User Interaction: The program interacts with the user, taking input for different geometric shapes and providing calculated results. The user can choose to exit at any point.

Exit Handling: The program gracefully exits and displays a goodbye message when the user chooses to end it.
